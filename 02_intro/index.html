        <p> For the 1st design, I misread the objective, thinkg we could construct anything in Fusion. I decided to make a batarang, inspired by the design from the Arkham video game series. I began my sktech by drawing a huge circle in the middle, and attaching the "wings" of the batarang using a mixture of curves and lines. Afterwards, I raised it into a 3D shape and added metallic texture to the surface. One of the hardest tasks was trying to make the ends of the wings equally sharp, and some points on the bottom aren;t symmetrical. Overall, I was very pleased with my model; then I realized it wasn't the objective asked for... <a href='../index.html'>link</a>. </p>
