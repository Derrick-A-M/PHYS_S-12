        <p>As shown above, this is the circuit we created in class using our Metro MO Express board. When the USB is plugged in, the LED should light up. It wasreally lifting to see the LED light up, and I even turned the lights off to see how bright it up be. The second picture is me measuring the voltage of the circuit using the multimeter. After building this circuit, I had to make my own in order to complete this week's task.</p>

        <p> Here are the voltage measurements:</p>

        <h3>My Work:</h3>
        <p> For week 3 my class was assigned the task of making our own circuit on a breadboard with tools in the kit. My Circuit was a simple LED/potentiometer, where the knob of the potentiometer could adjust the LED's brightness. The tools that I utilized for this assignment were an LED (blue), a potentiometer, breadboard, Metro MO Express board, a 100 ohm resistor, and some wires. First I made a simulation in TinkerCad. Initially, the process was frustrating as the potentiometer knob in the simulation wouldn't turn in some instaces. When the knob did turn, the LED was not affected. I took some time to fix the wiring, using other examples of potentiometer circuits to fix my error. To add insult to injury, when I tried to power p the LED it wouldn't light up, because I didn't connect a wire to the pin the LED was connected. Needless to say I had the biggest facepalm of my life. After finding a working simulation, I built the circuit, and inserted the following code so that the potentiometer could manipulate the LED. </p>
