        <p> In this 10th week of class, we learned how to utilize stepper motors and wooden cutouts to build machines. For our assignment, we used our resources and the stepper instructions given to us to make a machine. In preparation of our final, I decided to recreate the class example, as I intend to use it for my end project. Our instructors first introduced us to stepper motors: the largest and arguably most powerful in our kit, especially compared to the servo and motors. We were able to setup a circuit on our breadboards using a esp32 feather board, a motor driver, some wires and a capacitor. Next, we used the example codes on our class website to see how the motors move. When i finished my circuit and uploaded the code, I noticed that the motor wasn't appearing to move. The box was vibrating, but I saw no movement. After checking in with Ms. Shen, she assured me that the motor was moving, but that it was very difficult to see. She recommended applying yape around the rod of the motor, so that the movement would be more noticable. Needless to say, she was right.  </p>

        <p> Later on in our live class lecture, we used wooden laser cutouts shipped by Mr. Melenbrink and began construction a machine. The cutouts had holes that allowed them to be screwed onto the motor, along with holes for other parts to be attached. The design of the machine resembled that of a pulley, and with the motor activated, would move the pulley back and forth. Assembling the machine as fairly easy although some tedious obstacle did cross our paths. One of the tools used in this lesson, the bearings, had inner rings that wouldn't budge, meaning that if we wanted to place a screw through the bearing it would be damn near impossible. Luckily with a trusty hammer, I (along with my colleagues) were able to remove the inner rings. to add the finishing touches, we used 3D-printed parts made my Mr. Melenbrink so that the tread attached to two pulleys could be moved. </p>

        <p> My first idea for my final project was a random thought. In our class' 1st breakout room, I noticed a mosquito in my room and started thinking about how they bugged me all summer, especially when I was sleeping. I brainstormed about making something that would zap mosquitos into oblivion, but it seemed impractical and honestly, pretty dangerous. </p> 
        <h3>Bottle-Cap opening robot</h3>
        <p>This robot would grab a bottle using two claws, and a robotic arm at the top would place a bottle opener on the cap of something similar to a beer bottle to open it. I got the idea from my Dad's cap-opener on his keys and wanted to make a new design and put it on a robot. I took the advice of creating something that makes us lazier people</p>
        <h3>Wall-Painting Robot</h3>
        <p>This robot would go up and down walls, painting as it goes up and down. i would attached wires to the robot that are connected to nails on a wall, so that it can pull its self up. To paint the wal, I would add a roller underneath the bot.</p>
