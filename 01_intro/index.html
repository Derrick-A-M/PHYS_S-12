        <p> Here is an image of my GitHub page in Sublime: </p>

        <img src="./github-week1.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:90%" alt="GHUB week 1">

        <p> Although I had no knowledge about GitHub, I knew a little bit about coding from previous classes in middle school. I started by editing the default page that was set up for me. I followed up by adding logos to the week numbers on the main screen, to give a visual idea of the topics of said weeks. Inserting some of the images was tedious, as some pictures were too large or too small. To overcome this I edited the width and height of the images. Next, I tried to add a color and vibrant background, only for it to have 6 images of the same background all at once, when i only need one. After several frustrating minutes, I decided to make my background a simple blueviolet color for the time being.  </p>

        <h2>PROJECT IDEAS</h2>
        <h3>Mosquito-Killer</h3>
        <p> My first idea for my final project was a random thought. In our class' 1st breakout room, I noticed a mosquito in my room and started thinking about how they bugged me all summer, especially when I was sleeping. I brainstormed about making something that would zap mosquitos into oblivion, but it seemed impractical and honestly, pretty dangerous. </p> 
        <h3>Bottle-Cap opening robot</h3>
        <p>This robot would grab a bottle using two claws, and a robotic arm at the top would place a bottle opener on the cap of something similar to a beer bottle to open it. I got the idea from my Dad's cap-opener on his keys and wanted to make a new design and put it on a robot. I took the advice of creating something that makes us lazier people</p>
        <h3>Wall-Painting Robot</h3>
        <p>This robot would go up and down walls, painting as it goes up and down. i would attached wires to the robot that are connected to nails on a wall, so that it can pull its self up. To paint the wal, I would add a roller underneath the bot.</p>
