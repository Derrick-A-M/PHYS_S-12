        <p> Here is an image of my GitHub page in Sublime: </p>

        <p> Although I had no knowledge about GitHub, I knew a little bit about coding from previous classes in middle school. I started by editing the default page that was set up for me. I followed up by adding logos to the week numbers on the main screen, to give a visual idea of the topics of said weeks. Inserting some of the images was tedious, as some pictures were too large or too small. To overcome this I edited the width and height of the images. Next, I tried to add a color and vibrant background, only for it to have 6 images of the same background all at once, when i only need one. After several frustrating minutes, I decided to make my background a simple blueviolet color for the time being.  </p>
