        <p> In week 5: Programmable electronics, our class was introduced to Arudino's programming conditionals, and learn new functions suh as for(). For our assignemtn this week, we needed to program a microcontroller to produce an output using at least one button for input. For my work this week, I made a button that when pressed activates two LEDs. Using the Metro express board, green and yellow LEDs, a few resistors and one button, I was able to work on this assignment.</p>

        <p> Coding this assignment didn't offwe too much trouble, but designing teh circuit did. In hindsight, i should've used a TinkerCAD sim as my basis, as it would save me time and energy. One of the biggest problems was that the USB driver connecting my board to my PC would constantly go as unrecognized. I spoke with Mr. Melenbrink, and his input, along with the help of Faraz, a fellow student, I resolved this issue by plugging it into a second computer and double tapping the reset button. After adding a button, the LEDs, and 3 100 ohm resistors, my assignment worked as intended.</p>
