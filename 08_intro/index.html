        <h2>LED strip</h2> 

        <p class="thick"> For the class objective, we were given the option of setting up an output device that we've never used before. The outputs ranged from buzzers, whicch could be programmed to produce various noises, a TFT which could display images on a screen, or an LED strip that lights up. I ultimately chose to work on LED strips because i thought it would be fun to change and shift colors up and down the strip. I first used the code provided by to start it up, I hooked the LED strip to the esp32 Huzzah, and the LEDs lit up one by one in green. </p>
        <p>Here is a video of the LED strip:</p>

        <p> Next, in order to start preparing for the assignment, I started tinkering with the LEDs by using various codes to change their color. It took me a while to understand how to manipulate the colors by the 3 number format given, so for a decent amount of time i was stuck witht he color green. I kept on persisting, and was able to make the LEDs white. Later on, I was able to make Cyan, Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Purple. </p>

        <h2>Button LED Strip Circuit</h2>
        <p> For this assignment I made an LED strip that flashes between colors, with 2 buttons determining which color stays on. One the colors is cyan, so that it would have a cool color, and the other is a mix of red, orange, and yellow for more hot/warm colors. the board I used was the Adafruit ESP32 feather board. I wanted to use this board so that I could understand how it works, and incase my Adafruit Metro MO board were damaged or missing, I could use this as a backup for other assignments. I didn't simulate the circuit as TinkerCAD didn't have a board model similar to the feather board, so I immediately jumped into building the circuit through trial and error. I never used buttons in a circuit, so I had to look at images to determine how to create it and code for not only one, but two buttons. I placed the buttons close to each other and attached a 1k ohm resistor infront of it. I used some wires to connect the buttons to ground and to pins in the feather board. the power of the ciruit comes from the USB as 3.3V wasn't enough to power it on. I attached a wire from the USB port of the drive to the breadboard, and the voltage wire of the strip to a similar spot. </p>
